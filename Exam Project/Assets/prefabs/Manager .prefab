  - 'MANAGER: Oh, cut the crap, Jeff! The entire cities in chaos because of you. '
  - 'JEFF: I think I might know to fix it sir, but it wont be easy. Which is why
    I''m seeking information from you. '
  - 'MANAGER: and how, do you assumeI can help? Explain yourself. '
  - 'JEFF: Sir as much as I would like to be pulling your leg right now, I believe
    that the current events have a connection with the owner of the power plants
    family. '
  - 'MANAGER: Explain... '
  - 'JEFF: Oh, you see I met this wonderful woman, who seem to be able to read this
    book that has the family crest of the EX- family, and she discovered that there''s
    a sangoma who holds a grudge against the owner''s bloodline...'

  - 'JEFF:I don''t see the relevance right now but, my name is Jeffrey Shaka Mazibuko '
  - 'MANAGER: That cant be... That would mean,you are the illegitimate son of my
    old friend Shaka Dlamini, which '

    is a freaking multimillionaire... [with tears whirling up his face]. Can you
    please excuse me. I will vist you another time. '
